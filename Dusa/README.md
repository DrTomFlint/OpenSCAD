These are most of the files to create a 3D printer.  Additional files in Parts repo.

The printer is a Prusa style build with 2 extruders sharing a common X-axis set of linear rails.

The frame is T-slot with M5 hardware corner braces.
Power is 24 volt supply and an additional 12 volt DC/DC converter.
Controller board is a Duet 3 with a Raspberry Pi 4 attached.  
Firmware is Reprap 3 and the web interface on the Pi.
Hotbed is 24 volt ordered direct from the Prusa store.
Extruders are a pair of E3D Titan Aqua water cooled.
12 volt blowers for part cooling, also 12 volt fan for radiator, and 12 volt pump motor, all using PWM control for speed.
X and Y rails are 8mm with LM8U linear bearings.
Z axis uses 10 mm rails with LM10U bearings.
Z axis drive is 1.8 degree steppers with integrated leadscrews.
X, Y, and U (second extruder) motors are 0.9 degree steppers.
